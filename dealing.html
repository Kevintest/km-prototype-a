<h1 id="section_0">Fair dealing</h1>

<p><b>Fair dealing</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Limitations_and_exceptions_to_copyright" title="Limitations and exceptions to copyright">limitation and exception</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Exclusive_right" title="Exclusive right">exclusive right</a> granted by <a href="/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyright</a> law to the author of a creative work. Fair dealing is found in many of the <a href="/wiki/Common_law" title="Common law">common law</a> jurisdictions of the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>.</p>
<p>Fair dealing is an enumerated set of possible defences against an action for infringement of an <a href="/wiki/Exclusive_right" title="Exclusive right">exclusive right</a> of <a href="/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyright</a>. Unlike the related <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> doctrine of <a href="/wiki/Fair_use" title="Fair use">fair use</a>, fair dealing cannot apply to any act which does not fall within one of these categories, although <a href="/wiki/Common_law" title="Common law">common law</a> courts in some jurisdictions are less stringent than others in this regard.<sup id="cite_ref-handbook_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-handbook-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> In practice, however, such courts might rule that actions with a commercial character, which might be na√Øvely assumed to fall into one of these categories, were in fact infringements of copyright, as fair dealing is not as flexible a concept as the American concept of fair use.</p>

<p>Regarding the re-use of copyrighted images or drawings, the Australian <i>Copyright Act</i> does not impose a 10%-limit under its fair dealing provisions <i>for the purpose of research and study</i>. Instead, each and every such use for research or study must be evaluated individually to determine whether it is fair, similar to the notion of <a href="/wiki/Fair_use" title="Fair use">fair use</a> in U.S. copyright law. Among the criteria used to determine the fairness of a use are the purpose and character of the dealing, the nature of the work, the possibility of obtaining the work commercially within a reasonable time, the effect of the use on the potential market for the work or on its value, and how much of a work is copied.</p>
<p>In 2006, a federal law (<i>Copyright Amendment Act</i> 2006 (Cth) No. 158, 2006)<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> enabled parody and satire to qualify as fair dealing under federal copyright law in certain circumstances.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The Canadian concept of fair dealing is similar to that in the UK and Australia. The fair dealing clauses<sup id="cite_ref-Canadian_Fair_Dealing_Statute_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Canadian_Fair_Dealing_Statute-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_copyright_law" title="Canadian copyright law" class="mw-redirect">Canadian <i>Copyright Act</i></a> allow users to engage in certain activities relating to research, private study, education, parody, satire, criticism, review, or news reporting. With respect to criticism, review, and news reporting, the user must mention the source of the material, along with the name of the author, performer, maker, or broadcaster for the dealing to be fair.</p>
<p>Prior to 2011, fair dealing in Canada was not definitely found to contain exceptions for parody (unlike <a href="/wiki/Fair_use" title="Fair use">fair use</a> in the United States), but the Copyright Act has since been amended to include parody and satire (along with educational use) under its fair dealing provisions. Previously, a Quebec Court of Appeal in <i>Les productions Avanti Cine Video v. Favreau</i> (4 Aug 1999) had recognized that parody could potentially be a 'critique', however it refused to recognize the exception in that circumstance.</p>
<p>The 2004 ruling by the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada" title="Supreme Court of Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/CCH_Canadian_Ltd._v._Law_Society_of_Upper_Canada" title="CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada" class="mw-redirect">CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada</a></i> has gone far in clarifying the concept of fair dealing in Canada. In considering fair dealing the Court makes the following general observation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to clarify some general considerations about exceptions to copyright infringement. Procedurally, a defendant is required to prove that his or her dealing with a work has been fair; however, the fair dealing exception is perhaps more properly understood as an integral part of the Copyright Act than simply a defence. Any act falling within the fair dealing exception will not be an infringement of copyright. The fair dealing exception, like other exceptions in the Copyright Act, is a user's right. In order to maintain the proper balance between the rights of a copyright owner and users' interests, it must not be interpreted restrictively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, by taking "a liberal approach to the enumerated purposes of the dealing", the Court has made fair dealing more flexible, reducing the gap between this provision and US fair use<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>It then establishes six principal criteria for evaluating fair dealing.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>The Purpose of the Dealing</b> Is it for research, private study, criticism, review or news reporting (or additionally, since 2011, education, parody or satire)? It expresses that "these allowable purposes should not be given a restrictive interpretation or this could result in the undue restriction of users' rights." In particular, the Court gave a "a large and liberal interpretation" to the notion of research, stating that "lawyers carrying on the business of law for profit are conducting research".</li>
<li><b>The Character of the Dealing</b> How were the works dealt with? Was there a single copy or were multiple copies made? Were these copies distributed widely or to a limited group of people? Was the copy destroyed after being used? What is the general practice in the industry?</li>
<li><b>The Amount of the Dealing</b> How much of the work was used? What was the importance of the infringed work? Quoting trivial amounts may alone sufficiently establish fair dealing as there would not be copyright infringement at all. In some cases even quoting the entire work may be fair dealing. The amount of the work taken must be fair in light of the purpose of the dealing.</li>
<li><b>Alternatives to the Dealing</b> Was a "non-copyrighted equivalent of the work" available to the user? Was the dealing "reasonably necessary to achieve the ultimate purpose"?</li>
<li><b>The Nature of the Work</b> Copying from a work that has never been published could be more fair than from a published work "in that its reproduction with acknowledgement could lead to a wider public dissemination of the work - one of the goals of copyright law. If, however, the work in question was confidential, this may tip the scales towards finding that the dealing was unfair."</li>
<li><b>Effect of the Dealing on the Work</b> Is it likely to affect the market of the original work? "Although the effect of the dealing on the market of the copyright owner is an important factor, it is neither the only factor nor the most important factor that a court must consider in deciding if the dealing is fair."</li>
</ol>
<p>Though the Supreme Court outlined these six criteria, it noted that in some contexts, factors other than those listed may be relevant in determining whether a particular dealing is fair.</p>
<p>On June 2, 2010, the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Canada" title="Government of Canada">Government of Canada</a> introduced <a href="/wiki/Bill_C-32" title="Bill C-32" class="mw-redirect">Bill C-32</a>, An Act to amend the <a href="/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_Canada" title="Copyright Act of Canada">Copyright Act</a>. A summary of the changes proposed by this bill in terms of fair dealing notes that C-32 "expands the scope of the fair dealing exception at section 29 of the Act to include new purposes: education, parody or satire".<sup id="cite_ref-parl.gc.ca_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-parl.gc.ca-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> The stated aims of the revised bill were also to "permit businesses, educators and libraries to make greater use of copyright material in digital form".<sup id="cite_ref-parl.gc.ca_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-parl.gc.ca-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Bill C-32 had not passed by the time the minority Conservative government faced a vote of no-confidence and subsequently fell on March 25, 2011.</p>
<p>On September 29, 2011, the bill was re-introduced to the Forty-first Parliament as Bill C-11. With the backing of a majority Conservative government, this version of the Copyright Modernization Act has passed into law. Simply put, the fair dealing amendment in Section 29 of Bill C-11 expands the first criteria for evaluating fair dealing - the Purpose of the Dealing - to include education, and parody or satire, in addition to research, private study, criticism and review.</p>
<p>In a press release on the Government of Canada's Balanced Copyright site, the Honourable <a href="/wiki/James_Moore_(Canadian_politician)" title="James Moore (Canadian politician)">James Moore</a>, Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages, notes that the revamped bill "delivers a common-sense balance between the interests of consumers and the rights of the creative community".<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Critics of the bill point to "excessively restrictive digital lock amendments" <sup id="cite_ref-cbc.ca_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cbc.ca-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> that they claim will create a situation where people "are entitled to use copyrighted content lawfully but [are] prevented from doing so".<sup id="cite_ref-cbc.ca_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cbc.ca-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, fair dealing includes some copying for private study, research, criticism, review, and news reporting. Sections 42 and 43 of the <a href="/wiki/Copyright_Act_1994" title="Copyright Act 1994">Copyright Act 1994</a> set out the types of copying that qualify. The criteria are perhaps most similar to those applying in the UK, although commercial research can still count as fair dealing in New Zealand. Incidental copying, while allowed, is not defined as "fair dealing" under the Act. As in Canada, fair dealing is not an infringement of copyright.</p>
<p>The factors determining whether copying for research or private study is judged to be fair dealing in New Zealand are its purpose, its effect on the potential market or value of the work copied, the nature of the work, the amount copied in relation to the whole work, and whether or not the work could have been obtained in a reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price.</p>

<p>In South Africa, fair dealing is dealt with in the Copyright Act of 1978 (Act 98 of 1978, including subsequent amendments). Fair dealing itself is described in section 12(1) of the Act, whereas sections 13 to 19 explains various exceptions to copyright. Section 20 deals with the author's moral rights, which, if infringed, may also impact on a fair dealing ruling.</p>
<p>According to this Act,</p>
<p>Copyright shall not be infringed by any fair dealing with a literary or musical work</p>
<dl>
<dd>(a) for the purposes of research or private study by, or the personal or private use of, the person using the work;</dd>
<dd>(b) for the purposes of criticism or review of that work or of another work; or</dd>
<dd>(c) for the purpose of reporting current events
<dl>
<dd>(i) in a newspaper, magazine or similar periodical; or</dd>
<dd>(ii) by means of broadcasting or in a cinematograph film;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Provided that, in the case of paragraphs (b) and (c)(i), the source shall be mentioned, as well as the name of the author if it appears on the work.</p>
<p>Section 12 mentions both "fair dealing" and "fair practice", and it would seem that these two terms are equivalents. Musical works are compositions (i.e. manuscripts), not music recordings. The fair dealing exceptions do not apply to music recordings.</p>

<p>Under the <i><a href="/wiki/Copyright,_Designs_and_Patents_Act_1988" title="Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988">Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988</a></i> (CDPA), fair dealing is limited to the following purposes: research and private study (both must be non-commercial), criticism / review / quotation, and news reporting (sections 29, 30, 178); as well as parody, caricature and pastiche (section 30A) and illustration for teaching. Although not actually defined as a fair dealing, incidental inclusion of a copyrighted work in an artistic work, sound recording, film, broadcast or cable programme doesn't infringe copyright. Since 2014 the UK has protected the fair dealing exceptions from override by contracts or contractual terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Contrary to the often stated view, the provisions of section 29 of the CDPA do <i>not</i> state the amount of an in-copyright work that may be copied for the purposes of non-commercial research or private study or to single copies of the work, where the copies are made by the researcher or student himself. Such restrictions only apply to copies made by or on behalf of a librarian (by virtue of s. 40), or by a person, other than the researcher or student himself, who knows or has reason to believe that "it will result in copies of substantially the same material being provided to more than one person at substantially the same time and for substantially the same purpose" (by virtue of parag. s. 29(3)b).</p>
<p>For copying beyond the boundaries of fair dealing, universities and schools in the UK obtain licences from a national <a href="/wiki/Copyright_collective" title="Copyright collective">copyright collective</a>, the UK <a href="/wiki/The_Copyright_Licensing_Agency" title="The Copyright Licensing Agency" class="mw-redirect">Copyright Licensing Agency</a> (CLA).
